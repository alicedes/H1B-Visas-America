# H1B Visa Data Analysis

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing H1B visa application data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The H1B visa program allows US businesses to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations, such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers. However, obtaining an H1B visa is competitive due to the annual cap imposed by USCIS and the lottery system used for selection.

## Context

The project explores various factors influencing H1B visa applications, including:

- USCIS announcements regarding visa lottery
- Additional visas available due to incomplete visa processes
- Master's cap for advanced degree holders
- Non-profit exemptions from the visa cap

## Tasks

The analysis involves working with four CSV files containing disclosure data for different quarters of the fiscal year 2022. Each file contains over 500k records and more than 90 columns of information. The tasks include:

1. Uploading the raw data into an SQL server
2. Using SQL queries to process and analyze the data
3. Alternatively, connecting Power Query Editor to the SQL database for data transformation and analysis

## Data Files

- [LCA_Disclosure_Data_FY2022_Q1.csv]
- [LCA_Disclosure_Data_FY2022_Q2.csv]
- [LCA_Disclosure_Data_FY2022_Q3.csv]
- [LCA_Disclosure_Data_FY2022_Q4.csv]
- Sadly the files where to big so send me a request if you need them

## Requirements

- SQL Server for database management
- MySQL commands or Power Query Editor for data processing and analysis
- Cloud-based server for database hosting

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Upload the CSV files into your SQL database.
3. Use SQL queries or Power Query Editor to process and analyze the data.
4. Ensure to grant access to the assigned user (professor) for reviewing the work on the cloud-based server.
